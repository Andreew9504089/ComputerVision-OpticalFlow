# Optical Flow and Deep Learning Use Cases

[Optical Flow](OpticalFlow) explores three techniques to tackle the tracking problem:

1. Feature Tracking
2. Sparse Optical Flow
3. Dense Optical Flow

[FlowNet](FlowNet) illustrates Deep Learning for Optical Flow
by implementing the FlowNet algorithm using PyTorch and training the models on the KITTI dataset. The goal is to output the optical flow of two images, using the following steps:


[RAFT](RAFT) explores the RAFT deep network architecture for optical flow.

[Visual SLAM](VisualSLAM) shows an example of Visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) using visual features.
